# Telos_Works_Mass_Vote
This bash script will vote on ballots for you from a list of accounts in a text file call ```accounts.txt```.

It will ask you for the ballot name and if you want to vote yes or no, then run through your list of accounts and vote accordingly. 

You must have your wallet unlocked before running the script and the wallet must contain all the keys for the accounts in the file.
